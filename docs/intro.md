- Cover the basic knowledge required for embedded software (e.g.: how to read schematics, datasheets, etc...)
- The overall architecture of the project and how each repositories come together.
- The implementation of the software as well as how to use it.
- The testing procedure as well as known issues.

This organization will contain the code for the AstroCore framework, as well as its dependencies.
The objective of AstroCore is to provide an easy to use, modular framework for CubeSat missions.
It is written using the SPARK/Ada programming language to ensure high-reliability and for its implementation of formal verification methods.
