# Renode

## Introduction
### What is Renode?
Renode is a versatile platform that facilitates the emulation of hardware components and their peripherals. It is an invaluable tool for the development and testing of embedded software, especially for projects like CubeSat missions. Renode's capabilities extend to various microcontroller units (MCUs), making it a suitable choice for simulating hardware environments for your CubeSat software development.

### Benefits of Using Renode
#### Cost-Efficiency
Developing software for CubeSat missions often involves working with specialized and expensive hardware. Renode offers a cost-effective alternative by allowing you to create virtual hardware environments, reducing the need for physical hardware during the development phase. This not only saves money but also streamlines your development process.

#### Accessibility
Access to specific hardware components and peripherals can be challenging, especially for CubeSat mission projects with unique requirements. Renode overcomes this hurdle by providing a virtual platform where you can emulate a wide range of MCUs, ensuring that you have the flexibility to work with the hardware configurations required for your missions.

#### Supported MCUs
Renode supports a multitude of MCUs, including but not limited to:

- S32K344
- SAME70
- STM32F4

This variety of supported MCUs ensures that you can accurately model the hardware components relevant to our CubeSat mission projects.

## Installating Renode

### Windows
